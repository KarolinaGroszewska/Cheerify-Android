## Cheerify Android

Comment for part 3: We left off on adding Room â€“ more details on Room are listed at [this](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/android-room-with-a-view-kotlin#10) link. Parts 1-10 are working, but need to be customized for Cheerify.

Made for GHW: Beginners' Week in January 2024. Cheerify is an Android App with a [sister iOS App](https://github.com/KarolinaGroszewska/Cheerify).

Cheerify connects to a [open-sourced affirmation API](https://www.affirmations.dev/) and shows the affirmations to the users. Users can favorite affirmations, add custom affirmations, and regenerate affirmations based on their mood.
